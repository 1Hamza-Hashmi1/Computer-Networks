Wrote a simple "Hello" TCP application. The server establishes a connection, sends a "Hello" message to the client, then closes the connection and exits. The client waits for the message, displays it,and exits when the connection is closed (read system call returns 0). Modify the echo client and server to implement this. Figure 4 shows the system call sequence and packet exchanges.
